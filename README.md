# SecondExperimentPhD
 VR with C# and Unity.

This repository contains code used for the second experiment of my PhD with a Unity project. All assets used for the experiment are included. The Unity version of the project is 5.3.2f1 and may be required to open in its original form. The project includes all the assets used to generate the trailer, view replays and run the original version of the application used for experimentation.
